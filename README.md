# Cavestory  - *Work in progress*

### Cavestory remake in C++ using the SDL library

*Created by following [Limeoat's cavestory tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC1azHQrx_NgGnEv5KUZB2jA)*

### The following development libraries are needed:
 - SDL2
 - SDL2_image    
#### The .dll files will need to be placed in a folder named _game_ (or anything, just change the Makefile accordingly).
